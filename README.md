# MSA-Backend
The project solution consists of three different projects. The msa.phase2.api is the main web api project which has a simple controller for CRUD operation using InMemory EntityFrameworkCore. Services folder has Interface & services for dependency injection. FakeStore api is used to as third party api to get some data. The second project is Unit Testing which has one file to test the controller with the help of Moq, AutoFixture & FluentAssertions. The third project is msa.phase2.api.client, this project is a simple console app which could load data from db and print on console. The msa.phase2.api which is main project will start first and then msa.phase2.api.client. This is just to show demonstrate the starting the project with one file over another.
